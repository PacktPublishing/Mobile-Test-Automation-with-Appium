# Mobile Test Automation with Appium
This is the code repository for [Mobile Test Automation with Appium](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/mobile-test-automation-appium?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781787280168), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
Mobile security has come a long way over the last few years. It has transitioned from "should it be done?" to "it must be done!"Alongside the growing number of devises and applications, there is also a growth in the volume of Personally identifiable information (PII), Financial Data, and much more. This data needs to be secured.
## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.

Refer to readme file inside the Code Files folder for more information

The code will look like the following:
```
@Before

public void startAppiumServer() throws IOException {
      
    AppiumDriverLocalService appiumService =
    AppiumDriverLocalService.buildDefaultService();
    appiumService.start();

}
```

To get started with this book, you need basic knowledge of Java. You should be aware of the OOPS concept and should be able to use loops and define classes. A basic understanding of mobile apps and knowledge of Android would be an added advantage; however, it is not a must. The book provides hands-on experience with writing and executing code. There are some software prerequisites, which are explained in the second chapter, which helps set up the development environment and readies your machine for any future mobile automation work using Appium.
