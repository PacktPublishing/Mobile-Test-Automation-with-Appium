Hi Folks,

This project is created while the book Mobile Test automation with Appium was being authored. Since I have used Mac OSX,
most of the project path are local to my machine.

I. This project contains the below items:

    1. app folder - It contains the app under test
    2. Features folder - It contains the   feature files which are the Cucumber scenarios
    3. Pages - It contains the Page class for various pages in the Quikr app
    4. Steps - It contains the step implementation of the feature files
    5. Build.gradle - It's the gradle file for the project. It contains the task to run the functional test based on the
                      parameter "tags".


This code base is slightly different and I have done couple of more refactoring like
    1. moving the Desired Capabilities for iOS to Starting Steps
    2. adding one more System parameter to decide whether the test starts Android or iOS
    3. app path are relative to code base and not the absolute path

II. To run the android test in the project:
     1. Check out the project
     2. Launch an emulator or connect a device
     3. Update the StartingSteps class file with the :
            a.) same Platform Version as of Device/Emulator

          capabilities.setCapability("platformVersion", "5.1");

     4. Launch the terminal and run the below command to run the test

     gradle clean build runAllTest -Dtags=@search -DtargetDevice=android


III. To run the iOS test, you don't need to start the simulator. Make sure the simulator is there on your machine with below config:


        capabilities.setCapability("platformVersion", "8.4");
        capabilities.setCapability("deviceName", "iPhone 6");

        Launch the terminal and run the below command to run the test

     gradle clean build runAllTest -Dtags=@iOS -DtargetDevice=ios


IV. To run the mobile web test, update the scenario with the tag @search and make sure the simulator is started. Then run the following command:

      gradle clean build runAllTest -Dtags=@search -DtargetDevice=mweb


V. I have also included cucumber-sandwich.jar to generate beautiful HTML reports for cucumber test. Usage is

    1. Run the test from terminal/command prompt
    2. on the terminal, type in the below command
        java -jar cucumber-sandwich.jar -n -f build/reports/cucumber -o output/report
    3. This will create a report in output/report folder of the current directory


This pretty much completes the project. For any support with respect to the book,
